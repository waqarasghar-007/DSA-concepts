Symbol Table
Symbol tables are data structures that store key-value pairs, allowing efficient lookup, insertion, and
deletion operations based on the keys. They are commonly used in programming languages, compilers,
interpreters, and various other applications where symbols such as variables, functions, or identifiers
need to be stored and accessed.
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is one of the popular implementations for symbol tables. In this approach,
each key-value pair is stored as a node in the BST. The keys are used to organize and search the symbol
table, while the values hold the associated information or data.
Here's how symbol tables can be implemented using a BST:
1. Define the structure for the BST node: Each node in the BST will have fields to store the key,
value, and references to its left and right child nodes.
2. Create an empty BST: Initialize the root of the BST as null, indicating an empty symbol table.
3. Insertion: To insert a new key-value pair into the symbol table, perform the following steps:
a. Start from the root node.
b. If the tree is empty, create a new node with the given key-value pair and set it as the
root.
c. If the key is smaller than the current node's key, move to the left subtree. If the left
child is null, create a new node with the given key-value pair and set it as the left child. If
not null, continue to the left subtree.
d. If the key is larger than the current node's key, move to the right subtree. If the right
child is null, create a new node with the given key-value pair and set it as the right child.
If not null, continue to the right subtree.
e. Repeat steps c and d until an empty spot is found for insertion.
4. Searching: To search for a key in the symbol table, follow these steps:
a. Start from the root node.
b. If the tree is empty or the current node's key matches the search key, return the
corresponding value.
c. If the search key is smaller than the current node's key, move to the left subtree and
repeat the search process.
d. If the search key is larger than the current node's key, move to the right subtree and
repeat the search process.
e. Repeat steps c and d until a match is found or a null node is reached, indicating that the
key is not present in the symbol table.
5. Deletion: To remove a key-value pair from the symbol table, perform the following steps:
a. Find the node with the given key using the search process described above.
b. If the key is not found, the deletion operation terminates.
c. If the node to be deleted is a leaf node, simply remove it from the tree.
d. If the node to be deleted has only one child, bypass the node by replacing it with its
child.
e. If the node to be deleted has two children, find the successor node (the node with the
next highest key) by going to the right subtree and then as far left as possible. Replace
the node to be deleted with the successor node, and delete the successor node from its
original location.
By implementing symbol tables using a BST, you can achieve efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion
operations with an average time complexity of O (log n), where n is the number of key-value pairs stored
in the symbol table.
